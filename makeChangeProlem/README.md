This is my solution for the famous "Coin Change" problem.
Just run the script.sh file.
The 3 inputs are, Target sum, number of change, value of each change.
It will output all the ways to make the change.

Try running the 'chmod a+x script.sh' command to make it executable then run it using './script.sh'
Example:
