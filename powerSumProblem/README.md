This is my solution for the power sum problem. From 'geeksForGeeks.com'; Find ways an Integer can be expressed as sum of n-th power of unique natural numbers.
Just run the script.sh file.

For reference: "https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/count-ways-express-number-sum-powers/"

Try running the 'chmod a+x script.sh' command to make it executable then run it using './script.sh'
Example:
